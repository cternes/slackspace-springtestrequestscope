Test Request-Scoped Beans with Spring
=========================================

Run with maven
-------------------------

To run the tests in the project with maven simply type the following on the command line:  

    mvn clean compile test

Import as Eclipse Project
----------------------------
There is a project file included in the project folder, so you can import the project directly into eclipse as existing project.
